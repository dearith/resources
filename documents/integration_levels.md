# Integration levels

Repositories hosted inside the MetWork Organization have not the same level of integration, maturity or support.

We have several **cumulative** "integration levels" documented as a [repository topic](https://help.github.com/articles/about-topics/).

## Integration level 0

This is the default case if there is no `integration-level-*` topic on the repository.

No particular integration. Minimal support and unknown maturity. It is probably not ready for you.

## Integration level 1

No particular integration but reasonably supported. It is probably a fork of another repos with custom patches.
The project is visible in the organization custom dashboard. And the project must be integrated to our continuous integrations server.

## Integration level 2

We use the organization labels management with some automatic features from MetworkBot about them. The project must follow
our code of conduct. The main `README.md` file is automatically generated.

## Integration level 3

We follow the version numbering schema and the commit message guidelines with automatic changelog management.

## Integration level 4

We add the branching model with mandatory pull-requests on `integration` branch for example.
CLA must be signed by contributors.

## Integration level 5

Nothing new but just to showcase most interesting projects. The license must be BSD.
