# Long term ideas

- [ ] merge `mfcom` and `mfext` into a new `mfcore` module 
(because now with everything opensource, we don't need two distinct modules)
- [ ] replace `circus` by a something else (`circus` has bugs and does not seem to be maintained actively)
- [ ] `mfdata` and `mfserv` share a lot of things now => maybe we can merge them ? or we can see `mfdata` as a kind of plugin in `mfserv` ?
- [ ] (re)build `mflog` on https://www.structlog.org ? (see https://github.com/metwork-framework/resources/issues/28)
